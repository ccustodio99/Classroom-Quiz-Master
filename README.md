## 🎯 Types of Questions
This is what you ask the players. When creating a kahoot, you can use many different question formats to make your game more engaging:

**To Test Knowledge:**
 * **Quiz:** The classic format. A question with 2-4 multiple-choice answers, where only one is correct (or multiple can be correct).
 * **True / False:** A simple question with only two options.
 * **Type Answer:** Players must type the correct answer (with a 20-character limit). This is much harder as there are no options to guess from.
 * **Puzzle:** Players must drag and drop blocks into the correct order to form a sequence or sort items.
 * **Slider:** Players slide a pin to a specific number on a scale (e.g., "What year was this company founded?").

**To Gather Opinions (No points awarded):**
 * **Poll:** Ask the audience their opinion with multiple-choice options.
 * **Word Cloud:** An open-ended question where players submit short words. The most popular answers appear larger on the screen.
 * **Open-Ended:** Players can type and submit longer-form ideas or feedback.
 * **Brainstorm:** A collaborative mode where players submit ideas, and then the group can vote on their favorites.

> Tip: For the most reliable classroom experience, run live quizzes on a shared local network so the teacher and students stay connected even when the wider internet is unavailable.

## 🕹️ How Live Quizzes Work (Local Network First)
Classroom Quiz Master follows a host/participant model similar to Kahoot! but is optimized for intranet or offline hotspot play so teachers can keep the class engaged even when the wider internet is unreliable.

1. **Teacher Hosts the Session**
   - Build or select a module, then start a live delivery from the app. A short‑lived **Class Code** (e.g., `845 209`) appears on the teacher device.
   - Mirror the teacher screen to the class display (projector, TV, or a screen‑share app) so everyone can see questions, answer reveals, and the leaderboard.
   - All pacing, scoring, and media playback run on the host device; outbound internet calls are optional.

2. **Students Join on the Same LAN**
   - Students open the companion join screen on their phones, tablets, or laptops. When everyone is on the same Wi‑Fi—or the teacher spins up an offline hotspot—device discovery works over the local network broadcast.
   - Learners type the class code and choose a nickname (accounts optional). Rosters can be enforced for attendance.
   - Student devices act as lightweight controllers that send answer choices to the host. Color/shape cues match the shared display.

3. **Play, Score, Celebrate**
   - Questions appear on the shared screen; students respond from their devices. Correctness and response speed award points, while diagnostic pre/post tests automatically disable speed bonuses for fairness.
   - After each question, the leaderboard highlights the top five performers or teams to sustain excitement.
   - A podium animation closes the session. All response data is stored locally for instant reporting—no mandatory cloud sync.

### Why Local‑First Matters
- **Reliability:** Sessions continue even if campus internet drops; answers queue locally until the host confirms receipt.
- **Privacy:** Student nicknames and responses stay on the teacher device unless cloud sync is explicitly triggered.
- **Low Bandwidth Friendly:** Only lightweight LAN traffic is required. Remote challenges remain opt‑in for schools that prefer offline play.

## ▶️ Getting Started
1. **Open in Android Studio** (Ladybug or newer) and let Gradle sync.
2. Ensure **JDK 17**.
3. Run the **app** configuration on an emulator (API 34/35) or device.

```bash
# Quality & tests
./gradlew ktlintCheck detekt test connectedAndroidTest
```

> If you downloaded the provided starter zip, drop these files (**README.md**, **AGENTS.md**) in the project root.

## ⚙️ Optional Local Config
Create `app/src/main/assets/app-config.json` to toggle features:
```json
{
  "leaderboardEnabledByDefault": false,
  "feedbackMode": "after-section",
  "locale": "en-PH",
  "cloudSync": false
}
```

## 📊 Core Data Models (simplified)
```kotlin
data class Module(
  val id: String,
  val subject: String = "G11 General Mathematics",
  val topic: String,
  val objectives: List<String>,   // e.g., ["LO1","LO2","LO3"]
  val preTest: Assessment,
  val lesson: Lesson,
  val postTest: Assessment,
  val settings: ModuleSettings
)

data class Assessment(
  val id: String,
  val items: List<Item>,
  val timePerItemSec: Int = 60
)

sealed interface Item {
  val id: String
  val objective: String
}

data class NumericItem(
  override val id: String,
  override val objective: String,
  val prompt: String,
  val answer: Double,
  val tolerance: Double = 0.01,
  val explanation: String
) : Item
```
