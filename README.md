# Classroom Quiz Master — Mobile LMS Blueprint (Kotlin Android • Jetpack Compose)

A classroom-centric **Kotlin Android** LMS that now follows the full **Mobile LMS – Flow & Structure** blueprint: five-tab navigation, microlearning units, offline-first data sync with Firebase, and real-time live activities. Teachers still drive the **Pre‑Test → Lesson → Post‑Test** loop, but learners and admins now get dedicated spaces for catalog browsing, activity timelines, and privacy controls.

> **Platform:** Android (Kotlin) • **UI:** Jetpack Compose (Material 3) • **Arch:** MVVM + Clean Architecture • **Min SDK:** 24 • **Target SDK:** 34/35

## 🎓 How Classroom Quiz Master Works
Classroom Quiz Master orchestrates the end-to-end flow:
1. **Home (Tab 1)** – “Today’s Flow” feed with Tagalog labels (`Pagsusulit Bago ang Aralin`, `Talakayan / Aralin`, `Pagsusulit Pagkatapos ng Aralin`), classroom cards, and quick live-session launch.
2. **Learn (Tab 2)** – Catalog of microlearning courses (3–7 minute units) auto-generated from modules, with search over objectives and difficulty tags.
3. **Classroom (Tab 3)** – Google Classroom-style manager for Stream/Classwork/People/Grades, with module wiring and LAN-ready live delivery.
4. **Activity (Tab 4)** – Streaks, badges, certificates, and engagement analytics powered by the gamification agent.
5. **Profile (Tab 5)** – Account, privacy, download controls, and explicit offline-first sync actions (push/pull to Firebase).

Global accents include a floating **➕ quick-action button** (scan code / redeem key / join cohort), search entry points, and notification hooks. Everything runs locally via Room, then mirrors to Firebase Realtime Database/Firestore when online.

## 📱 5-Tab Navigation Map
- **Home** – “Today’s Flow” feed combining pre-test, lesson, post-test, reminders, streak insights, and persona guidance (Learner, Instructor, Admin).
- **Learn** – Searchable catalog of `CourseSummary` objects; each course splits into `LearningUnit` blocks (Pre-test, Lesson, Post-test, Live) with estimated minutes.
- **Classroom** – Roster, Stream/Classwork topics, quick module creation, and LAN-ready live session launchers.
- **Activity** – Aggregated `ActivityTimeline` showing streak days, unlocked `Badge`s, and downloadable certificates.
- **Profile** – Account identity, consent reminders, and manual sync controls backed by the `SyncAgent` (`Push modules`, `Pull updates`). Logging out preserves all cached data.

## 🔐 Accounts & Access Control
- **Default Admin:** On first launch the app seeds `admin@classroom.local` / `admin123`. Use this account to approve new teachers and students.
- **Teacher & Student Signup:** Tap **Sign up** on the login screen to request access. Teachers can immediately browse the classroom manager once approved; students go straight to the join screen.
- **Admin Approval:** Pending accounts appear under the **Pending approvals** list. Approving an account promotes it to active status and unlocks the appropriate home screen.
- **Local-First Storage + Firebase Mirror:** Credentials, classes, and modules are cached offline via Room, then mirrored to Firestore when sync runs.
- **Session Awareness:** The app remembers the current account while running. Logging out returns to the authentication screen without deleting any data.

### 🌩️ Cloud Sync (Firebase + Room)
- **Structured Data:** Modules are serialized and pushed to Firestore. The `updatedAt` timestamp protects against concurrent edits (newer copies win).
- **Offline First:** Every change lands in Room immediately; Firestore sync is best-effort and safe to run even without connectivity.
- **Conflict Feedback:** If Firestore has a newer version, pushes fail fast so teachers can pull updates before overwriting a peer.
- **Learning Materials:** Binary assets (slides, docs, media) are still local by default. Point the `SyncAgent` to WebDAV/Synology to offload them if desired.

### 🧑‍🏫 Teacher Experience
1. **Create or Import a Lesson Module** - Define objectives, attach slides/media, and configure timers, randomization, and optional leaderboards across the pre/lesson/post segments.
2. **Launch a Live Session** - Tap **Start Live Delivery** to generate a short-lived class code (e.g., `845 209`). Mirror your device to a projector, TV, or screen-share so everyone sees prompts and leaderboards.
3. **Monitor and Report** - Scores, participation, and learning gains are stored locally. Export PDF or CSV reports to highlight objective mastery and commonly missed concepts.

### 👩‍🎓 Student Experience
1. **Join the Session** – Open the join screen on any phone, tablet, or laptop connected to the same Wi‑Fi or the teacher’s offline hotspot. Enter the class code and nickname or ID.
2. **Play and Engage** – Watch the shared display for questions and respond from personal devices. Scoring balances accuracy and fairness—pre/post diagnostics disable speed bonuses.
3. **Privacy & Reliability** – No mandatory accounts or cloud sync. All data stays on the teacher’s device, enabling fully offline operation for low-connectivity classrooms.

### ✨ Core Capabilities
- **Module Flow:** Pre‑Test → Lesson/Discussion → Post‑Test with parallel forms for diagnostic comparison.
- **Delivery Modes:** Live classroom sessions and asynchronous assignments.
- **Reports & Exports:** Automatic Pre vs Post analytics, objective mastery insights, and PDF/CSV exports.
- **Engagement:** Optional leaderboards, podium celebrations, and lightweight gamification (avatars/badges).
- **Localization:** Tagalog labels across key teacher-facing surfaces.
- **Blueprint Additions:** `CourseSummary`, `LearningUnit`, `HomeFeedItem`, and `ActivityTimeline` models drive the mobile LMS shell, while `CatalogRepository` keeps home feed, catalog, and activity data in sync with Room + Firebase.

## 🧩 Question Types
| Purpose | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Test Knowledge** | Multiple Choice | 2–4 options with one or more correct answers. |
|  | True / False | Quick factual checks with binary choices. |
|  | Numeric Entry | Students type numeric answers with tolerance settings. |
|  | Matching | Pair related terms, formulas, or definitions. |
|  | Type Answer | Short response (≤20 characters) with variant matching. |
|  | Puzzle | Arrange steps or ideas in the correct order. |
|  | Slider | Indicate a numeric value or confidence level. |
| **Gather Opinions** | Poll | Collect quick opinions or gauge understanding. |
|  | Word Cloud | Players submit one word; popular answers grow larger. |
|  | Open-Ended | Invite longer reflections or feedback. |
|  | Brainstorm | Collaborative idea generation with optional voting. |

## 🕹️ Live Quiz Flow (Local-First Design)
1. **Teacher Hosts the Session** – Run the module locally; all timing, scoring, and media playback stay on the teacher device.
2. **Students Join via Local Network** – Devices auto-discover the session across LAN or the teacher’s hotspot—no internet required.
3. **Play, Score, Reflect** – After each question, the leaderboard updates live. Responses feed into instant analytics comparing Pre vs Post performance.

### Why Local-First Matters
- **Reliability:** Sessions stay stable even if campus internet drops; submissions queue until confirmed.
- **Privacy:** Student data remains on the teacher device unless optional sync is enabled.
- **Low Bandwidth:** Requires only lightweight LAN traffic, ideal for resource-constrained schools.

### 🧠 Example Module Flow
**Module:** Simple Interest and Compound Interest (Objectives: LO1, LO2, LO3)

`Pre-Test → Lesson Slides → Interactive Quizzes → Post-Test → Report`

Each stage feeds into the performance report, highlighting mastery per objective and growth between pre and post assessments.

## 🧑‍🏫 Teacher Setup Checklist
1. **Create the Classroom or Subject Shell** – Tag the section, subject, and schedule so reports group correctly.
2. **Author the Lesson Package** – Define objectives, attach slide decks or reference files, and align each objective with the right assessment items.
3. **Build the Pre-Test** – Select or import diagnostic questions, tuning timers and feedback rules for fairness.
4. **Plan the Guided Lesson** – Sequence slides, worked examples, and mini activities; attach external media for live presentation or assignments.
5. **Assemble the Post-Test** – Create a parallel assessment to measure learning gains on the same objectives.
6. **Configure Interactive Activities** – Blend quizzes, polls, and brainstorms for synchronous or asynchronous engagement.

> Keeping everything inside a single module lets teachers reuse the package for live sessions or assignments while automatically tracking pre/post gains.
